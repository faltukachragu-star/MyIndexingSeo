        <h1>Privacy Policy for Notificrawl</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: [Enter Today's Date]</em></p>

        <p>Notificrawl ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our web application (the "Service").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use our Service, you authenticate using Google's OAuth 2.0. We collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Account Information:</strong> We receive basic profile information from Google, such as your email address, to identify your session. We do not receive or store your Google password.</li>
            <li><strong>Google API Credentials:</strong> We store your OAuth access and refresh tokens securely in your server-side session cookie to make requests to the Google Indexing API on your behalf. These are not logged or stored permanently by us.</li>
            <li><strong>Submitted URLs:</strong> We process the URLs you submit through our interface to send them to the Google Indexing API. We do not store these URLs after the processing is complete.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and operate the Service.</li>
            <li>To authenticate you and manage your session.</li>
            <li>To submit your requested URLs to the Google Indexing API on your behalf.</li>
            <li>To troubleshoot issues with the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your authentication tokens are stored in a secure, signed session cookie on your browser and managed by our server during your active session. We do not store this information in a permanent database. We take reasonable measures to protect your information, but no security system is impenetrable.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. The only time your data is shared is when we make an API call to Google on your behalf using your own credentials, which is the core function of the Service.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You can revoke our Service's access to your Google Account at any time by visiting the "Apps with access to your account" section of your Google Account settings.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
